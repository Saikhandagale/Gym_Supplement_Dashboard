# Gym_Supplement_Dashboard
Project Objective
To analyze product sales data and uncover insights on revenue, discounts, returns, and product performanceâ€”supporting data-driven business decisions through interactive charts in Jupyter Notebook.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Used
A structured sales dataset (CSV) including features like product category, revenue, discount %, return rate, platform, location, and time of sale.


##ðŸ“ˆ Questions (KPIs) Explored
What are the top product categories by average revenue per unit sold?

How do discount percentages impact total revenue and units sold?

Which products generate the most revenue and which face the highest return rates?

What are the sales trends over time?

How does performance vary across platforms and locations?

Which categories balance high revenue with low return rates?

What patterns exist in seasonal or monthly sales?

##ðŸ›  Process
Performed data cleaning and transformation using Pandas.

Aggregated and grouped data by product, category, and region for deeper insights.

Created visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn (e.g., bar plots, scatter plots, pie charts, and line graphs).

Added interactive widgets (like dropdowns and sliders) using ipywidgets for dynamic filtering inside the notebook.

##ðŸ“Œ Project Insights
Creatine, Fish Oil, and Vitamin C ranked highest in total revenue.

A negative trend was observed between high discounts and revenue beyond a threshold (~10%).

Electrolyte Powder and Zinc had the highest return rates.

Product categories like Creatine and Multivitamins had the most consistent revenue per unit.

Amazon accounted for over 50% of total sales volume.

Some regions responded more strongly to discounts in terms of units sold.

Sales showed weekly and monthly spikes, hinting at promotional impact or seasonality.

##âœ… Conclusion
This Jupyter Notebook-based dashboard enabled interactive, visual exploration of key sales KPIs.
The project made complex metrics accessible to stakeholders and improved data-driven decision-making through clear storytelling and visuals.
